# Anomalous-Behavior-Detection-using-Anomalib-and-DFKDE
This repository presents a comprehensive project demonstrating the application of Anomalib, a powerful anomaly detection framework, in conjunction with the DFKDE (Deep Functional Kernel Density Estimation) model. The primary goal is to develop a robust model capable of effectively identifying anomalous cans and bottles in a given dataset.
